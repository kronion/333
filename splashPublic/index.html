<P> You're scrolling through days of old posts trying to find that fascinating article about mantis shrimp that you stumbled across on Facebook the other day because you know your date is really into marine life. You're trying to impress her, but you can't remember who shared it originally and now you just look weird because you swear it was a really cool article but you just can't find it anymore.
Today's social networks relentlessly push new data which bury old, valuable content below hundreds of GIFs and click-bait articles. With 'Chive, you can keep track of the videos, pictures, and news that are important to you and share it with your friends in one place. 'Chive archives and organizes your content, making it easy to connect concepts or search in the future. Instead of going through all the boring statuses of “friends” you barely know, you can choose to follow certain people and the read articles that interest them. Use it privately as a smart replacement for bookmarks or publically as a forum for discussion of the latest news!</P>

<P> How to access or create a running version of your system.
If your system is web-based, this should be a URL.
If your system is stand-alone on some public or private machine, we
need to be able to access it on that machine.  
If your system is a phone application,
this should reference an installable version.
Don't forget passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them.

<P> Who to contact in case something goes wrong.

<blockquote>
<P> <a href="a-link-to-your-project-web-page"> Your project's web page</a>
or home page or the like: the place to find all public information
about your project.
This may be the same link as the "how to access a running version"
page.

<P> These links must point to PDF files <b>with with exactly the
specified names</b>.  They must not require logging in to some place
like Google Docs or GitHub.  My goal is to have the submissions all in
one place and completely uniform at this level so the TAs and I can
access the pieces easily.

Thanks.
